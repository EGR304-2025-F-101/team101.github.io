### Main Method for Group Communication

Based on the information provided on in the "Team Member Communication Modes," the group primary method of communication is phone messages for communication and Discord for virtually meeting communication.
 
## Communication Procedures

1. How will your team communicate?  
-> Our team wll communicate using phone messages and discord.
3. How will you handle instructor correspondence? Who is responsible? How will that be communicated with/back to the group?  
-> Our team will designate one member as the primary point of contact for instructor correspondence. This person will be responsible for checking messages regularly, responding in a timely manner, and sharing all communication with the team. If the designated member is unavailable, another teammate will temporarily take over as the contact.

## Meeting Coordination

1. What method will you use to remind yourselves of meetings (a shared calendar?)  
-> We will be using google Calendar (shared), everyone gets event invites with notifications on their phone/computer.
   We can also set up a weekly Routine, Agree on a fixed time so reminders aren’t as critical.
3. How will your team go about changing or adding meeting times?  
-> We will discuss everyone’s schedules and agree on a meeting time that works for all team members.
   Our team will primarily meet virtually through Discord for scheduling flexibility.
4. Are there any other procedures that your team feels are necessary?  
-> Our team will work to distribute the workload fairly. We will regularly review progress to ensure no single member is overloaded.
