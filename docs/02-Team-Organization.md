## Team Charter

From the team appendix which can be reviewed in [https://egr304-2025-f-101.github.io/team101.github.io/Appendix/App-Team-Org/], the team's charter formed to be focused on designing, building, and testing an embedded system that works well and shows decication to our product. We’ll share ideas, fairly distribute the work, and help each other along the way. Our goal is to finish with a completed working project, improve our skills in the process, and build good design habits we can carry beyond this class. We want to create something we’re proud to share and improve our abilties as future engineers.  

## Product Mission Statement

“We want to explore new ideas in engineering, build real projects together, learn how to work as a team, and grow our skills through hands-on experience.”
